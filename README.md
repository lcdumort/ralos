Just a very small solar system simulation developed after a midnight bet.

## Installation
There are 2 requirements: **numpy** for the calculations, **matplotlib** for the visualisation. You can install them through

```pip install numpy matplotlib```

## Usage
Pretty straight-forward: running
```python3 mainscript.py```
will calculate a system with a sun (yellow), our earth (blue) and a randomly added planet. Enjoy and feel free to play around!
